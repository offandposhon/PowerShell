# PowerShell
A better way of learning PowerShell by doing PowerShell.  'Nuff said.
Mimicry isn't the always the best way to learn something.  We all do this - from toilet training to the fashions of the current era.  I could either go around wearing a toilet for fashion or shit myself in public, but nothing would get done or change.
There is a better way.  There must be a way to learn the mistakes easily, other than the "hello world" approach to programming.
This is not one of those githubs.
